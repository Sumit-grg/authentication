// REACT SANDBOX - AUTHENTICATION CHALLENGE

// Base challenge
// Add authentication to your react sandbox application using the google provider. Include some basic conditional rendering so we can see when the user is singed in/out (simplest would be to include a header that toggles between "please sign in with google" & "welcome to the sandbox app".

EXTENSIONS:
// Use the returned info in the user object to render a display name, profile image and email address

// Edit your application and firebase project to include sign in with email and password (will require you to read the firebase docs)

// Edit your application and firebase project to include sign in with facebook functionality (will require you to read the firebase docs)
